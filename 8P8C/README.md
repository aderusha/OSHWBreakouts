### Amphenol RJHSE-538*x*

The Amphenol RJHSE-538*x* (also RJHSE-L38*x*) series of shielded 8P8C connectors are horizontally mounted to a PCB and offer 2 LED lights (commonly, green and yellow).  This footprint is widely cloned by Chinese suppliers making for an inexpensive and readily-available solution for prototyping.
