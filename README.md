# OSHW Breakout Boards

I occasionally have had need for various breakout boards and when I can't find what I'm after I'll design my own and share the results here.

All PCBs have been designed with the excellent [KiCad EDA software](http://kicad-pcb.org/) and full source files for every design are included.  All designs are offered under [MIT License](LICENSE).
